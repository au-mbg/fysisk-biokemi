## Difference between $Q$ and $K_{eq}$

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 6)
```

Consider the reaction:

$$
A \rightleftarrows B
$$

The time course of the reaction was followed monitoring formation of the product $B$. The starting concentration of $A$ was 50 µM, and as you will learn later in the course, the reversible reaction going from $A$ to $B$ follows first order kinetics. 

#### (a) Load & convert

The data is contained in the `reverse_reaction.xlsx` file.

```{python}
#| eval: false
from fysisk_biokemi.widgets import DataUploader
from IPython.display import display 
uploader = DataUploader()
uploader.display()
```

Run the next cell **after** uploading the file

```{python}
#| eval: false
df = uploader.get_dataframe()
display(df)
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
from IPython.display import display 
from fysisk_biokemi.datasets import load_dataset
df = load_dataset('diff_q_keq') # Load from package for the solution so it doesn't require to interact.
display(df)
```

Convert the measured concentrations of $B$, $[B]$, to concentrations in the SI-unit $\mathrm{M} \ (\mathrm{mol/L})$. Repeat for the starting concentration of $A$, $[A]_0$.

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
df['[B]_(M)'] = ...
A0 = ...
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
df['[B]_(M)'] = df['[B]_(uM)'] * 10**(-6)
A0 = 50 * 10**(-6)
```


#### (b) Law of mass balance

Use the laws of mass balance to calculate $[A]$ as a function of time in the unit $\mathrm{M}$, 
add it as a column to the `DataFrame` 

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
... # Your code here.
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
df['[A]_(M)'] = A0 - df['[B]_(M)']
```

#### (c) Mass action ratio

Calculate and plot the mass action ratio $Q$ as a function of time.

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
Q = ... # calculate Q 
```

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))

... # Make the plot
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
#| fig-align: center
Q = df['[B]_(M)'] / df['[A]_(M)']

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))

ax.plot(df['Time_(min)'], Q)
ax.set_xlabel('Time (min)')
ax.set_ylabel('Mass action ratio $Q$')
```

#### (d) $Q$ vs $K_{eq}$

What is the difference between $Q$ and $K_{eq}$? 

#### (e) Favoured compound

Which of the two compounds $A$ and $B$ is favored at equilibrium? (Favored: highest concentration)

#### (f) Equilibrium constant

What is the equilibrium constant of this reaction?

#### (g) Reequilibriate

Assume that an additional $10 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$ $A$ is added at timepoint, $t=35$ min. What is the concentrations of $A$ and $B$ when equilibrium has been reached again say at $t > 70$ min?
