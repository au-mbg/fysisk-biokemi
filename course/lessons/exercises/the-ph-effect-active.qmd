## The pH effect on an active site histidine residue

Assume that a compound R can react with the unprotonated form of Histidine, 
$\text{His}$, to form a covalent reaction product, $\text{P}$:
$$
\text{His} + \text{R} \rightarrow \text{P}
$$

The protonated form of Histidine, $\text{HisH}^+$, is in equilibrium with $\text{His}$:

$$
\text{HisH}^+ \rightleftharpoons \text{His} + \text{H}^+
$$

The pKa value for this acid-base equilibrium is 6.0. Further assume that the total
concentration of Histidine, is

$$
[\text{HisH}^+] + [\text{His}] = 10^{-3} \ \text{M}
$$

#### (a) Percentage unprotonated

Using the Henderson-Hasselbach equation, calculate the percentage of unprotonated 
Histidine, $\text{His}$, at pH 6.0. 

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false 

## Your set known values. ##
pKa = ...
pH = ...

## Your task: percentage of unprotonated 
## It may be useful to do an intermediate calculation..
... # Intermediate
percentage_unprotonated = ...

## Prints
print(percentage_unprotonated)
```

```{python}
#| solution: true

## Your set known values. ##
pKa = 6.0
pH = 6.0

## Your task: percentage of unprotonated 
## It may be useful to do an intermediate calculation..
ratio = 10 ** (pH - pKa) # The intermediate
percentage_unprotonated = 1 / (1 + ratio) * 100

## Prints
print(percentage_unprotonated)
```

#### (b) Concentration 

Calculate $[\text{His}]$ at pH 6

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false

## Your task: Assign known value and calculate [His]
total_conc = ...
his_conc = ...
print(his_conc)
```

```{python}
#| solution: true

## Your task: Assign known value and calculate [His]
total_conc = 10**(-3)
his_conc = total_conc * percentage_unprotonated
print(his_conc)
```

#### (c) Reaction order

The reaction equation for the reaction between  $\text{His}$ and $\text{R}$ is 

$$
v = - \frac{d[\text{His}]}{dt} = k \cdot [\text{His}] \cdot [\text{R}]
$$

What's the reaction order? 

```{python}
#| solution: true
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
answer=r"""
::: {.callout-important}

## Answer
Bimolecular so we expect second order reaction.

:::
"""
print(answer)
```


#### (d) High concentrations

If $[\text{R}]$ is much higher than $[\text{His}]$, what can then be concluded regarding the order of the reaction? 

```{python}
#| solution: true
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
answer=r"""
::: {.callout-important}

## Answer
$[R]$ will remain roughly constant - we are thus in the regime of a pseudo first order reaction

:::
"""
print(answer)
```

#### (e) New rate constant

Show how a new rate constant, $k'$, can be defined in these conditions. How does $k'$ depend on $\text{R}$?

```{python}
#| solution: true
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
answer=r"""
::: {.callout-important}

## Answer
$v = k \cdot [\text{His}] \cdot [\text{R}]$

$k^{\prime} = k[\text{R}]$

$v = k^{\prime}[\text{His}]$


Then $k^{\prime}$ is linearly proportional with $[\text{R}]$.

print(answer)
```


#### (f) SI Units

At pH 6.0 the reaction rate $v = 1 \ \text{mM}\cdot \text{s}^{-1}$.

Convert the reaction rate to SI-units given in $\text{M}\cdot \text{s}^{-1}$.

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false

# Your task: Calculate v in SI units M / s
reaction_rate = ...
print(reaction_rate)
```

```{python}
#| solution: true

# Your task: Calculate v in SI units M / s
reaction_rate = 1 * 10**(-3) # Units: M / s
print(reaction_rate)
```

#### (g) Calculate the rate constant 

Use the concentration of $[\text{His}]$ at pH 6 calculated in question (b), the reaction rate from (f) and constant $[\text{R}] = 0.2 \ \text{M}$ to calculate the rate constant $k$. 

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| exercise: true

## Your task: Set known value and calculate k ##
## Hint: You should use the his_conc and reaction_rate variables ##
R_conc = ...
k = ...
```

```{python}
#| solution: true

## Your task: Set known value and calculate k ##
## Hint: You can use the his_conc variable ##
R_conc = 0.2
k = reaction_rate / (R_conc * his_conc)
print(k)
```
