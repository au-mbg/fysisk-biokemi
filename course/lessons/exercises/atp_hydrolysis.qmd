## ATP hydrolysis

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import numpy as np
```


Below is shown the structure of ATP.

$\Delta G^\circ´$ for the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi is $-30.5 \ \mathrm{kJ/mol}$.

#### (a) $\Delta G´$

In cells at $298 \ \mathrm{K}$ the steady state concentrations of ATP, ADP og Pi resulted in a value for the reaction quotient $Q = \frac{\mathrm{[ADP]}[\mathrm{Pi}]}{[\mathrm{ATP}]} = 0.002$. Calculate ΔG’ under these conditions. 

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false

# Known values:
dG_std_prime = ... # kJ / mol
Q = ...
T = ...
... # One more might be useful.

# Calculation:
dG_prime = dG_std_prime + R*T*np.log(Q)
print(dG_prime)
```

```{python}
#| solution: true

# Known values:
Q = 0.002
T = 298 # K
dG_std_prime = -30.5 # kJ / mol
R = 8.314 * 10**(-3) # kJ /(mol K)

# Calculation:
dG_prime = dG_std_prime + R*T*np.log(Q)
print(dG_prime)
```

#### (b) Equilibrium or not? 

Assuming that the temperature within these cells is $298 \ \mathrm{K}$, are these cells in equilibrium with respect to the hydrolysis of ATP? 

#### (c) ATP synthesized

Calculate the number of moles of ATP synthesized by a resting person in a period of 24 hours, assuming that the energy consumption by this person is $8368 \ \mathrm{kJ}$ per 24 hours and that 40% of this energy is converted directly into ATP without loss of energy. Use the ΔG’ value calculated in question a, and assume that $298 \ \mathrm{K}$.

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
energy_atp = ...
synth_atp = ...
print(synth_atp)
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
energy_atp = 0.4 * 8368 # kJ
synth_atp = energy_atp / np.absolute(dG_prime)
print(synth_atp)
```

::: {.callout-tip}

You can use `np.absolute` to calculate the absolute value of a number.

#### (d) Turnover

Next, calculate the average number of times each ATP molecule is turned over (synthesis followed by hydrolysis) in 24 hours when the total amount of ATP in the body equals $0.2 \ \mathrm{mol}$.

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
... # Your calculation here
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
total_atp = 0.2 
turn_over = synth_atp / total_atp
print(turn_over)
```
