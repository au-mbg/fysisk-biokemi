## The fluorescent protein "mCherry".

The spectra of many fluorescent proteins can be found at the website: [www.fpbase.org](https://www.fpbase.org/). Go to FPbase and search for “mCherry”. 

#### (a) Find parameters. 

Find the following parameters for the protein

- Extinction coefficient at absorbance maximum 
- Quantum yield 
- The organism from which it was originally isolated
- Molecular weight

Save them to seperate variables in the cell below.

```{python}
#| solution: true
QY = 0.22
EC = 72000 # [1/(M cm)]
organism = "Discosoma sp."
m_w = 26.7 * 10**3 # From fpbase
```

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
... # Your answers here. 
```

#### (b)	Adorbance

What is the absorbance of a 1 µM solution of mCherry at its absorption maximum?

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
c = ... # Put the concentration in Molar
l = ... # Path length in cm
A_max = ... # Calculate the adsorbance.
print(f"{A_max = :3.3f}")
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
c = 1 * 10**(-6) # [M]
l = 1 # [cm]
A_max = EC * c * l
print(f"{A_max = :3.3f}")
```

#### (c)	Extinction coefficient from sequence. 

The sequence of the protein is also given. From this determine the extinction coefficient at 280 nm.

Start by taking the sequence from the website and assigning it to the variable `sequence` in the cell below. 

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
sequence = ... # Your code here
```
```{python}
#| solution: true
sequence="""MVSKGEEDNM AIIKEFMRFK VHMEGSVNGH EFEIEGEGEG RPYEGTQTAK LKVTKGGPLP FAWDILSPQF MYGSKAYVKH PADIPDYLKL SFPEGFKWER VMNFEDGGVV TVTQDSSLQD GEFIYKVKLR GTNFPSDGPV MQKKTMGWEA SSERMYPEDG ALKGEIKQRL KLKDGGHYDA EVKTTYKAKK PVQLPGAYNV NIKLDITSHN EDYTIVEQYE RAEGRHSTGG MDELYK"""
```

Now use the sequence to calculate the extinction coefficient, finish the code below 
(or take the function you implemented in a previous exercise!)

```{python}
#| exercise: true

# This is "dictionary" with the extinction coefficients of the relevant 
# amino acid residues. Dictionaries are indexed with 'keys', so you can retrieve
# the value for W as: ext_residue["W"].
ext_residue = {"W": 5500, "Y": 1490, "C": 125}

# Write code to calculate the extinction coefficent
...
```

```{python}
#| solution: true

# This is 'dictionary' with the extinction coefficients of the relevant 
# amino acid residues. Dictionaries are indexed with 'keys', so you can retrieve
# the value for W as: ext_residue["W"].
ext_residue = {"W": 5500, "Y": 1490, "C": 125}

# Count the number of active residues
N_trp = sequence.count("W")
N_tyr = sequence.count("Y")
N_cys = sequence.count("C")

# Calculate the extinction coefficient: 
ext_coeff = N_trp * ext_residue["W"] + N_tyr * ext_residue["Y"] + N_cys * ext_residue["C"]

print(f"{ext_coeff = :3.3f}")
```

#### (d)	What is the concentration of a 1 µM solution of mCherry in mg/mL?

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
conc_molar = ... # Put the concentration in units of M. 
conc_mg_mL = ... # Calculate the concentration in uts of mg/mL.
print(f"{conc_mg_mL = }")
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
conc_molar = 1 * 10**(-6) # From 1 [uM].
conc_mg_mL = conc_molar * m_w 
print(f"{conc_mg_mL = }")
```

#### (e)    Load the dataset

Use the widget below to load the dataset as a `DataFrame`

```{python}
#| eval: false
from fysisk_biokemi.widgets import DataUploader
from IPython.display import display 
uploader = DataUploader()
uploader.display()
```

Run the next cell **after** uploading the file

```{python}
#| eval: false
df = uploader.get_dataframe()
display(df)
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
from IPython.display import display 
from fysisk_biokemi.datasets import load_dataset
df = load_dataset('mCherry') # Load from package for the solution so it doesn't require to interact.
display(df)
```

#### (f)	Plot spectra

Make your own plot showing the excitation and emission spectra of “mCherry” using the above data.

::: {.callout-tip}

To plot we use the `matplotlib` package. Plots are generally just straight lines 
connecting points, with enough points we get a smooth looking figure. 

For example, to plot a line connecting three datapoints

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots() # <1>

x = np.array([1, 2, 3]) # <2>
y = np.array([1, 4, 9])
ax.plot(x, y) # <3> 
plt.show() # <4>
```
1. This creates a `fig` and an `ax`, the `ax`-object is the box where our plot is created. 
2. Define the data to put on the x-axis.
3. Does the actual plotting
4. Shows the figure

There are *many* ways of customizing plots, you will see different ones in the exercises, but 
by no means all of them - if you are interested you can find more information on the [matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index).

You don't have to worry about the `NaN` values in the dataset when plotting, matplotlib just skips 
plotting that line segment.

::::

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9, 4))
ax.plot(..., ..., label='Excitation') # Replace ... with your code
... # Replace ... with your code plotting the emission spectrum.
ax.legend()
ax.set_xlabel('Wavelength')
ax.set_ylabel('Extinction & Emission')
plt.show()
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9, 4))
ax.plot(df['wavelength'], df['mCherry ex'], label='Excitation')
ax.plot(df['wavelength'], df['mCherry em'], label='Emission')
ax.legend()
ax.set_xlabel('Wavelength')
ax.set_ylabel('Extinction & Emission')
plt.show()
```

#### (g)	Stokes shift

What is the Stokes shift of mCherry?

::: {.callout-tip}

If you have two arrays `A` and `B` you can find the entry in `A` corresponding to the largest 
value in `B` like this 

```python
A_at_B_max = A[np.argmax(B)]
```
The `np.argmax` stands for **arg**ument **max**imum meaning that it finds the index of 
the maximum value in a given array. The figure below illustrates this 

::: {#fig-npargmax}

Illustration of argmax

:::
::: 

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
import numpy as np
# Start by extracting the wavelengths from the DataFrame
wavelengths = ...

# Find the indices
ex_max_idx = np.argmax(...)
em_max_idx = ...

# Use the index to find the corresponding wavelengths
lambda_ex = wavelengths[...]
lambda_em = ...

stokes_shift = ...

print(f"{lambda_ex = :d}")
print(f"{lambda_em = :d}")
print(f"{stokes_shift = :d}")
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
import numpy as np
# Start by extracting the wavelengths from the DataFrame
wavelengths = df['wavelength']

# Find the indices
ex_max_idx = np.argmax(df['mCherry ex'])
em_max_idx = np.argmax(df['mCherry em'])

# Use the index to find the corresponding wavelengths
lambda_ex = wavelengths[ex_max_idx]
lambda_em = wavelengths[em_max_idx]

stokes_shift = lambda_em - lambda_ex

print(f"{lambda_ex = :d}")
print(f"{lambda_em = :d}")
print(f"{stokes_shift = :d}")
```

#### (h)	Colors 

What colors are the light that correspond to the excitation and emission maxima respectively?
