## UV spectrum of apo- and holo-myoglobin

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

In this exercise we will analyze the spectra of apo- and holo-myoglobin. 
The dataset is given in `uv-spec-apo-holo-myo.csv`. 

#### (a) Load the dataset

Use the widget to load the dataset.

```{python}
#| eval: false
from IPython.display import display 
from fysisk_biokemi.widgets import DataUploader
uploader = DataUploader()
uploader.display()
```
Run this cell **after** having uploaded the file in the cell above.
```{python}
#| eval: false
df = uploader.get_dataframe()
display(df)
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
from fysisk_biokemi.datasets import load_dataset
from IPython.display import display 
df = load_dataset('apo_holo') # Load from package for the solution so it doesn't require to interact.
display(df)
```

#### (b) Plot the spectra

::: {.callout-tip}

To plot we use the `matplotlib` package. Plots are generally just straight lines 
connecting points, with enough points we get a smooth looking figure. 

For example, to plot a line connecting three datapoints

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots() # <1>

x = np.array([1, 2, 3]) # <2>
y = np.array([1, 4, 9])
ax.plot(x, y) # <3> 
plt.show() # <4>
```
1. This creates a `fig` and an `ax`, the `ax`-object is the box where our plot is created. 
2. Define the data to put on the x-axis.
3. Does the actual plotting
4. Shows the figure

There are *many* ways of customizing plots, you will see different ones in the exercises, but 
by no means all of them - if you are interested you can find more information on the [matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index).

You don't have to worry about the `NaN` values in the dataset when plotting, matplotlib just skips 
plotting that line segment.

::::

Using `matplotlib` plot each spectrum in the same figure as line plots. 

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
fig, ax = plt.subplots() 

# This selects the 'holo_absorbance'-column and plots it
ax.plot(df['wavelength'], df['holo_absorbance'], label='Holo')

# Copy the line above and edit it to also plot the Apo absorbance
... # Your code here

ax.set_ylabel('Absorbance (AU)')
ax.set_xlabel('Wavelength (nm)')
```

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
#| solution: true
fig, ax = plt.subplots() 

ax.plot(df['wavelength'], df['holo_absorbance'], label='Holo')
ax.plot(df['wavelength'], df['apo_absorbance'], label='Apo')

ax.set_ylabel('Absorbance (AU)')
ax.set_xlabel('Wavelength (nm)')
```

Based on the spectra explain what ApoMb and HoloMb represent? 

---

You have learned that pure proteins without any UV/Vis-absorbing prosthetic groups bound, have basically no
absorbance at wavelengths above λ>320 nm. Nevertheless ApoMb still show some absorbance above 320 nm.
In this case, it can explained by the fact that ApoMb was generated from HoloMb by a procedure that will not
be explained here.

---

#### (d) Absorption above 320 nm.

Explain why ApoMb in the spectrum above absorbs light at λ>320 nm.

#### (e) Efficiency estimate.

Give a rough estimate of the efficiency of the chosen procedure of heme-group removal. 
You may wish to look at the numerical values in the `DataFrame`.

#### (f) Isobestic points

Are there any isobestic points between the two spectra?

---

To get a better understanding of the causes for the different spectra, you can compare to litterature. 
The figure below shows the absorbance spectra of three states of myoglobin.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{MbFe(II)O_2} &\Rightarrow \mathrm{oxyMb} \\
\\
\mathrm{MbFe(III)} &\Rightarrow \mathrm{metMb} \\
\\
\mathrm{MbFe(II)} &\Rightarrow \mathrm{deoxyMb}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### (g) Aged myoglobin

metMb $(\mathrm{MbFe(III)})$ is normally described as ‘aged’ myoglobin. What does this mean in terms of the
bound iron?

```{python}
#| solution: true
"""In the aged state, the oxidation number of the iron is +3. The change in oxidation number of iron (+2 vs +3) in fresh vs aged myoglobin means that the electron configuration in the d- orbitals are different, which will affect the way iron is bound in the heme group"""
```


#### (h) Change in absorbance

Give a qualitative explanation to the observed change in absorbance of metMb compared to fresh oxy-/deoxyMb?

```{python}
#| solution: true
"""
The changed in electronic configuration and the difference this causes to how iron is bound in the hemegroup influences the absorption.Moreover binding of oxygen via the iron again changes the electron configuration of the iron atom, resulting in differences between deoxy- and oxymyoglobin
"""
```

#### (i) Type of shift

Is the spectral difference from deoxyMb to metMb a redshift or a blueshift?

```{python}
#| solution: true
"""
The absorbance peak in metMb is at lower wavelength (higher energy) as compared to deoxyMb, and is therefore described as a blueshift.
"""
```

#### (j) Experiment design

You would like to set up an experiment where the absorbance of myoglobin at defined
wavelength(s) should be used to measure the level of $\mathrm{O}_2$ binding. Sketch how the
absorbance spectra would look like when going from deoxyMb and continuously increasing
the concentration of $\mathrm{O}_2$ (draw this for five different $\mathrm{O}_2$ concentrations going from pure
deoxyMb to pure oxyMb)
