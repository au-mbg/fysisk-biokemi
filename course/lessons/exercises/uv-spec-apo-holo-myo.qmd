## UV spectrum of apo- and holo-myoglobin

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

In this exercise we will analyze the spectra of apo- and holo-myoglobin. 
The dataset is given in `uv-spec-apo-holo-myo.csv`. 

#### (a) Load the dataset

Use the widget to load the dataset.

```{python}
#| eval: false
from IPython.display import display 
from fysisk_biokemi.widgets import DataUploader
uploader = DataUploader()
uploader.display()
```
Run this cell **after** having uploaded the file in the cell above.
```{python}
#| eval: false
df = uploader.get_dataframe()
display(df)
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
from fysisk_biokemi.datasets import load_dataset
from IPython.display import display 
df = load_dataset('apo_holo') # Load from package for the solution so it doesn't require to interact.
display(df)
```

#### (b) Plot the spectra

Using `matplotlib` plot each spectrum in the same figure as line plots. 

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
fig, ax = plt.subplots() 

# This selects the 'holo_absorbance'-column and plots it
ax.plot(df['wavelength'], df['holo_absorbance'], label='Holo')

# Copy the line above and edit it to also plot the Apo absorbance
... # Your code here

ax.set_ylabel('Absorbance (AU)')
ax.set_xlabel('Wavelength (nm)')
```

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
#| solution: true
fig, ax = plt.subplots() 

ax.plot(df['wavelength'], df['holo_absorbance'], label='Holo')
ax.plot(df['wavelength'], df['apo_absorbance'], label='Apo')

ax.set_ylabel('Absorbance (AU)')
ax.set_xlabel('Wavelength (nm)')
```

Based on the spectra explain what ApoMb and HoloMb represent? 

---

You have learned that pure proteins without any UV/Vis-absorbing prosthetic groups bound, have basically no
absorbance at wavelengths above λ>320 nm. Nevertheless ApoMb still show some absorbance above 320 nm.
In this case, it can explained by the fact that ApoMb was generated from HoloMb by a procedure that will not
be explained here.

---

#### (d) Adsorption above 320 nm.

Explain why ApoMb in the spectrum above absorbs light at λ>320 nm.

#### (e) Efficiency estimate.

Give a rough estimate of the efficiency of the chosen procedure of heme-group removal.

#### (f) Isobestic points

Are there any isobestic points between the two spectra?

---

To get a better understanding of the causes for the different spectra, you can compare to litterature. 
The figure below shows the absorbance spectra of three states of myoglobin.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{MbFe(II)O_2} &\Rightarrow \mathrm{oxyMb} \\
\\
\mathrm{MbFe(III)} &\Rightarrow \mathrm{metMb} \\
\\
\mathrm{MbFe(II)} &\Rightarrow \mathrm{deoxyMb}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### (g) Aged myoglobin

metMb $(\mathrm{MbFe(III)})$ is normally described as ‘aged’ myoglobin. What does this mean in terms of the
bound iron?

#### (h) Change in absorbance

Give a qualitative explanation to the observed change in absorbance of metMb compared to fresh oxy-/deoxyMb?

#### (I) Type of shift

Is the spectral difference from deoxyMb to metMb a redshift or a blueshift?

#### (J) Experiment design

You would like to set up an experiment where the absorbance of myoglobin at defined
wavelength(s) should be used to measure the level of $\mathrm{O}_2$ binding. Sketch how the
absorbance spectra would look like when going from deoxyMb and continuously increasing
the concentration of $\mathrm{O}_2$ (draw this for five different $\mathrm{O}_2$ concentrations going from pure
deoxyMb to pure oxyMb)
