## Enzymatic behaviour of the enzyme ATCase

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

The enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) catalyzes the first reaction in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines
such as CTP as shown in the reaction below:

ATCase does not obey the Michaelis-Menten kinetics model but instead shows the behaviour recorded in the 
`atcase_enzyme.csv` dataset.

The dataset consists of three columns; the aspartate concentration in mM and the rate of formation of N-carbamyolaspartate
with and without the presence of CTP. 

Load the dataset with the widget below

```{python}
#| eval: false
from fysisk_biokemi.widgets import DataUploader
from IPython.display import display 
uploader = DataUploader()
uploader.display()
```

Run the next cell **after** uploading the file

```{python}
#| eval: false
df = uploader.get_dataframe()
display(df)
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
from IPython.display import display 
from fysisk_biokemi.datasets import load_dataset
df = load_dataset('atcase') # Load from package for the solution so it doesn't require to interact.
display(df)
```

#### (a) Plot the dataset

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

... # Put some code here
... # And here

ax.set_xlabel('[Aspartate] (mM)')
ax.set_ylabel('Rate of formation')
ax.set_yticklabels([]);
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.plot(df['aspartate'], df['without_ctp'], label='No CTP')
ax.plot(df['aspartate'], df['with_ctp'], label='With CTP')

ax.set_xlabel('[Aspartate] (mM)')
ax.set_ylabel('Rate of formation')
ax.set_yticklabels([]);
```

#### (b) Kinetic profile

Describe the kinetic profile of ATCase and explain what it tells us about the way ATCase works. (You may find inspiration in the material previously covered on protein-ligand interactions)

#### (c) Quarternary structure

What does the figure tell us about the quaternary structure of ATCase?

#### (d) DNA synthesis

Which other pyrimidine based trinucleotide besides CTP is used to synthesize DNA?

#### (e) Effect of CTP

Qualitatively describe the effect of CTP on the rate of N-carbamyolaspartate formation

#### (f) Physiological advantage

In fact many enzymes are regulated by certain end products in a fashion similar to the CTP effect on ATCase. Can you explain why this might be a physiological advantage?
