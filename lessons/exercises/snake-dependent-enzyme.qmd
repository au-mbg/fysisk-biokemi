## A snake dependent enzyme 

When (or *if* depending on your outlook in life) you are bit by a cobra, the snake protein CVF interacts with the human protein FB to form a
proteolytically active enzyme in the blood called CVF:FB. CVF:FB enzyme is able to cleave another human
protein known as C5 into C5b and C5a (C5a is the protein you visually inspected in your first PyMOL session).
With C5 as a substrate, CVF:FB obeys the Michaelis-Menten kinetics model, whereas CVF alone does not show
any catalytic activity towards C5.

Now consider two different CVF proteins, CVF1 and CVF2 from two different cobra species. Upon
characterization it was found that CVF1:FB has a $K_M = 0.036 \ \mu\text{M}$ and a $k_{cat} = 0.43 \ \mathrm{min}^{-1}$, whereas CVF2:FB has a $K_M = 14 \mu\mathrm{M}$ and a $k_{cat} = 0.73 \ \mathrm{min}^{-1}$. The concentration of C5 in blood is $0.37 \ \mu\mathrm{M}$.

#### (a)

Convert the given $K_M$ values and the C5 concentration to SI-units given in $\mathrm{M}$

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false

# CVF1
K_m_cvf1 = ...
k_cat_cvf1 = ...

# CVF2
...
...

# Concentration
C_c5 = ...
```

```{python}
#| solution: true

# CVF1
K_m_cvf1 = 0.036 * 10**(-6)
k_cat_cvf1 = 0.43 / 60

# CVF2
K_m_cvf2 = 14 * 10**(-6)
k_cat_cvf2 = 0.73 / 60

# Concentration
C_c5 = 0.37 * 10**(-6)
```


#### (b)

Assuming that [CVF1:FB] $=$ [CVF2:FB] $= 0.1\cdot 10^{-6} \ \mathrm{M}$, calculate $V_\mathrm{max}$ of both enzymes.

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false

V_max_cfv1 = ...
...

print(f"{V_max_cfv1 = :.3e}")
print(f"{V_max_cfv2 = :.3e}")
```

```{python}
#| solution: true

V_max_cfv1 = k_cat_cvf1 * 0.1 * 10**(-6)
V_max_cfv2 = k_cat_cvf2 * 0.1 * 10**(-6)

print(f"{V_max_cfv1 = :.3e}")
print(f"{V_max_cfv2 = :.3e}")
```

#### (c)

Calculate the fraction of enzyme:substrate complexes (CVFx:FB:C5) in blood.

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
theta_cfv1 = ...
theta_cfv2 = ...

print(f"{theta_cfv1 = :.3f}")
print(f"{theta_cfv2 = :.3f}")
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
theta_cfv1 = C_c5 / (K_m_cvf1 + C_c5)
theta_cfv2 = C_c5 / (K_m_cvf2 + C_c5)

print(f"{theta_cfv1 = :.3f}")
print(f"{theta_cfv2 = :.3f}")
```

#### (d)
 
Calculate the initial velocities of C5 cleavage in blood by the two enzymes.

```{python}
#| exercise: true
#| eval: false
v0_cfv1 = ...
v0_cfv2 = ...

print(f"{v0_cfv1 = :.3e}")
print(f"{v0_cfv2 = :.3e}")
```

```{python}
#| solution: true
v0_cfv1 = (V_max_cfv1 * C_c5) / (K_m_cvf1 + C_c5)
v0_cfv2 = (V_max_cfv2 * C_c5) / (K_m_cvf2 + C_c5)

print(f"{v0_cfv1 = :.3e}")
print(f"{v0_cfv2 = :.3e}")
```

#### (f)

Which of the two enzymes, CVF1:FB or CVF2:FB, cleaves the most C5 molecules in blood?
